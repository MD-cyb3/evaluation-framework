# Evaluation Framework

The [Evaluation Framework](https://github.com/siemens/evaluation-framework) is a set of open source software libraries and tools in [C\# ](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/dotnet/csharp/csharp), implemented in .[NET](https://www.microsoft.com/net), and [Python](https://www.python.org/) for efficiently evaluating simulation models of mechatronic systems, in particular by using the game engine [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) as simulation environment, and visualizing the evaluation results in an interactive GUI.

The Evaluation Framework is the result of [Michael Dyck's](https://github.com/MD-cyb3) Master's thesis entitled 'Development of a Simulation-Based Evaluation Framework for Mechatronic Systems', which he did in the course of his Master's studies 'Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence' at [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/en/), (Germany). The thesis was written together with [Dr. Martin Bischoff](https://github.com/MartinBischoff) from Siemens AG, as well as [Jonis Kiesbye]() from the [Chair of Astronautics (LRT)](https://www.lrg.tum.de/en/lrt/home/) and [Jonas Wittmann](https://github.com/jonasTUM) from the [Chair of Applied Mechaincs (AM)](https://www.mw.tum.de/en/am/home/) of [TUM](https://www.tum.de/en/).

[Here](https://github.com/siemens/evaluation-framework/wiki/Demonstration-Project) is an application example illustrating what can be done with the Evaluation Framework.
